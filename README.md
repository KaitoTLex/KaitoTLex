## Yahallo ☄️

I am Kaito or Ren.  

An aspiring electrical engineer and nuclear physicist.  

I wish to develop electronics that is _redundant_ and _reliable_ to be used in intense environments. I hope to design my own sets of instruments as scientific equipment for physics.  

I run a GNU/Linux distribution [NixOS](https://nixos.org) ensuring safety and redundancy of my OS. NixOS is a purely functional (in mathematics) lambda calculus based operating system that allows you to run predictable deployments in other systems. Within NixOS I run [*VSCodium*](https://vscodium.com/) to develop on non-low level programming languages and NixCat-based [NeoViM](https://neovim.io/) that allows my determinant operating system to purify NeoViM. 

## did, working, moving
- I have worked on a arduino-based 8-bit cycling computer which is capable of logging cadence, speed changes through time, as well as distance. 
- I am currently working on a [TVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring) rocket with a couple of friends. 
- I want to work on Meta-Rayban intelligent mixed-reality glasses, with subtitle features. 

## fluency
- I have experience using low level languages such as C++, C, Fortran, Rust, and Cobol
- I have worked with ARM sdk, OpenGL, GNU Science Library and currently learning Vulkan
- I have experience with high level languages such as Julia, Python (Oh the Horror!) and Java
- I have experience CADing in Altium Design, KiCAD, Eagle CAD, Fusion 360 and Solidworks
- I have little to no experience with simulations.

Hoshiyomi and Mafuyu fan.

This means that many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are integrated into me rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric difference is exploited more than is customary. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
