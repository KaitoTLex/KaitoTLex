I am Kaito or Ren. [find me here](https://kaitotlex.systems)

An aspiring electrical engineer, with interest in researching Nuclear Physics, Quantum Error Correction, and Simple Category Theory. 

I wish to develop electronics that is _redundant_ and _reliable_ to be used in intense environments. I hope to design my own sets of instruments as scientific equipment for physics.  

I run a GNU/Linux distribution [NixOS](https://nixos.org) ensuring safety and redundancy of my OS. NixOS is a purely functional, declarative and determinantive operating system that allows one to run predictable deployments in other systems. Within NixOS I run two IDEs: [*VSCodium*](https://vscodium.com/) to develop on non-low level programming languages and NixCat-based [neovim](https://neovim.io/) that allows my determinant operating system to purify neovim.

I am currently working on mutiple projects including a flake that allows one to run NixOS on a clockworkPi, Cycling computer hijacking the power meter from my crankset, and possibly a low-power f91-w board forked from the sensorwatch project. There are also other projects that i'm working on that you may be more interested reading on [schematic](https://yap.kaitotlex.systems). 

I am working on projects with [@MIT-OpenCompute](https://www.mit.edu/~ajzd/opencompute/), [functor.systems](https://functor.systems), and myself. 

<!-- ## did, working, moving -->
<!-- - I have worked on a arduino-based 8-bit cycling computer which is capable of logging cadence, speed changes through time, as well as distance.  -->
<!-- - I am currently working on a [TVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring) rocket with a couple of friends.  -->
<!-- - I want to build a open source core following the RISC-V instruction standard -->

## fluency
- I have experience using low level languages such as C++, C, Fortran, Rust, and Cobol
- I am currently learning VHDL, System Verilog, Verilog, Chisel(Scala)
- I have worked with ARM sdk, GNU Science Library, and currently learning OpenGL
- I have (some) experience with high level languages such as Julia, Python and Java
- I have experience CADing in Altium Design, KiCAD, Eagle CAD, Fusion 360 and Solidworks
- I have little to no experience with simulations(except for verilator).
- I can speak: 國文(Mandarin), English, 明南語(Taiwanese)

This means that many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are integrated into me rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric difference is exploited more than is customary. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
